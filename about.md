[WhosThatCop](https://whosthatcop.org)
is a website
that allows
the public
to search
for LAPD officers
by serial number.

## The Story

On September 9, 2022,
Twitter user [NN](https://twitter.com/NN35007)
[debuted](https://twitter.com/WhosThatCop/status/1568420590629044225)
their new bot,
[WhosThatCop](https://twitter.com/WhosThatCop).
It gives
Twitter users
information about
an LAPD officer
when given
the officer's serial number.

The bot was [suspended](https://twitter.com/WhosThatCop/status/1569197405580705793/photo/1)
after less than three days,
flagged by Twitter
for ["unusual behavior
that violates
the Twitter Rules."](https://twitter.com/WhosThatCop/status/1569797446150287360)

Although the bot was
quickly re-instated,
I decided that
this was something that should
be available
off of Twitter,
not subject
to the whims
of a multi-billion dollar corporation,
and available
to people
who don't want
to use Twitter.

So on September 16, 2022,
I started building
[WhosThatCop.org](https://whosthatcop.org).
